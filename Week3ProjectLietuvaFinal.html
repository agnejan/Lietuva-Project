      <p>
        You are small, you easily find room in the palms of a ƒåiurlionis'
        King...
        <br />
        You are like a slice of
        <span class="description">wholesome bread </span>on the festive table of
        the world...<br />On the globe you are a tiny patch, a steel plate from
        a Gr√ºnwald suit of armour, <br />A trace of Pirƒçiupis ablaze with blood,
        a crystal droplet of a <span class="description">sky-blue lake</span>,
        <br />A bright green sunrise over fallow lands, a rain of sunbeams on a
        city square. <br />On the globe you are an
        <span class="description">amber speck</span> with the scent of pinewood
        and the gleam of blood... <br />Only in our love you're truly great and
        in our palms you are invincible <br />And in our dreams you are a
        fairy-tale and in our eyes you are a land of sunshine. <br />
